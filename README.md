Problem-1: Write a program to enter any number and find its factorial using constructor.

Problem-2: Create a class called COMPLEX that has two private data called real and imaginary. Include constructor function to input real and imaginary values, show() to display complex numbers. Write a program to add two complex numbers.

Problem-3: Write a program with class to find whether a given number is prime or not.
Problem-4: Write a program to append the contents of a file into another.

Problem-5: Write a program that finds the volume of different shapes (like rectangle, cylinder, cube) using function overloading.

Problem-6: Write a class to represent time that includes the member function to perform the following: * Take input for time in hours and minutes. * Add two times. * Display the time in form hours : minutes.

Problem-7: Write a program to find the largest and smallest number between two numbers of different classes.

Problem-8: Create a class float that contains one float data number. Overload all the four arithmetic operators for two objects.


Problem-9: Given the following base class:
```c++
    class area_cl
     {public:
          double height;
          double width;
     };
```
Create two derived classes called rectangle and isosceles that inherit area_cl. Have each class include a function area() that returns the area of a rectangle isosceles triangle as appropriate. Use parameterized constructor to initialize height and width. Write the complete program.
